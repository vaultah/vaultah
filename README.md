### Hey, I'm vaultah

I live the life of a Python programmer, but I am also familiar with many other languages and technologies,
and specialize at everything and anything.

If you are looking for recent examples of my work, check out [replicat](https://github.com/vaultah/replicat).
In addition to being a useful utility that seems to work great, it has been an interesting and a slightly
challenging project that touched on areas that I would love to continue exploring -- cryptography, math,
low-level programming, cross-platform software, C++, and concurrency.
